            The Case For HEPMA.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Medicines represent the most frequent healthcare intervention – there are approximately 34 million prescriptions and 122 million administrations of medicines per year in NHS Scotland. However, the vast majority of medicines used in hospitals are still prescribed, and their administration recorded, using a paper based chart system, and with the increasing range and complexities of medicines available, the safe and effective prescribing and administration of medicines is challenging.

    <h2>What is HEPMA</h2>
    <p>
        HEPMA will combine three functions to provide all clinical staff with an integrated view of a patient’s medication history, through: electronic communication of a prescription or medicine order aiding the choice, administration and supply of a medicine through knowledge and decision support providing a robust audit trail for the entire medicines use process. Medicines represent the most frequent healthcare intervention; Healthcare Improvement Scotland reported that each year in an average 500 bedded acute hospital approximately 435,000 items are prescribed resulting in 2 million doses of medicine being administered to patients . Treatment with medicines saves lives, controls and cures diseases and provides symptom control. However, the majority of medicines used in hospitals are still prescribed and administered using a paper-based chart system.  The safe and effective prescribing and administration of medicines is thus limited by legibility challenges, multiple handover points, poor integration with clinical systems especially in primary care and a lack of data on medicine usage. Experience following the introduction of electronic prescribing systems in general practice over 2 decades has demonstrated improvements in quality of care, medicines utilisation and prescribing practice.

        Why JAC/WellSky HEPMA Solution 
    </h3>
    <p>
        Under the current multi-supplier Framework Agreement there were only  two HEPMA solution suppliers to select from. These were suppliers that had successfully progressed through an assessment phase and had been awarded accreditation for use by Scottish health boards. The suppliers were;
